go-teamweek
===========

[Go](http://golang.org) library for accessing the [Teamweek API](https://developers.teamweek.com/api-v4.html)

### Usage ###

```go
import "github.com/toggl/go-teamweek/teamweek"
```

Create a new Teamweek client instance, then use provided methods on the client to
access the API. For example, to list all accounts:

```go
client := teamweek.NewClient(nil)
accounts, err := client.ListAccounts()
```

### Authentication ###

The go-teamweek library does not directly handle authentication. Instead, when
creating a new client, pass an `http.Client` that can handle authentication for
you. The easiest way to do this is using the [goauth2][] library, but you can
always use any other library that provides an `http.Client`. If you have an OAuth2
access token, you can use it with the goauth2 using:

```go
t := &oauth.Transport{
  Token: &oauth.Token{AccessToken: "... your access token ..."},
}

client := teamweek.NewClient(t.Client())

// Get authenticated user's profile information
profile, err := client.GetUserProfile()
```

See the [goauth2 docs][] for complete instructions on using that library.
